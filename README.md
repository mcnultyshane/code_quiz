# Javascript Code Quiz

## Project Description

This project was designed to build a Javascript code quiz and learn out way around applying data from a web page and storing it locally in the DOM.  This project was a bit challenging for me in terms of laying out functionality and methods for the page.  Nonetheless it was a great learning experience.  Some last minute boot camp lessons on bootstrap came in handy in the pinch to help me quickly with layouts and design.  I know the look is still a bit rudamentary do to the bulk of my time on this project being dedicated to the javascript.
